# Word-Search

As a final assignment of a Python course, I coded this game, that consists of finding words.

My alphabet soup is programming flavored :D

In orden to play the game, you have to open the wordsearch.py file. You'll be asked to open a board file and a word list file (you can create your own wordlists and boards!!).

Enter the player's name, then start looking for words!

The longer the word, the more points you'll get. 

Have fun!
