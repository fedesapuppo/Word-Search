# Word-Search

As a final assignment of a Python course, I coded this game, wich consists of finding words.

My alphabet soup is programming flavored :D

In order to play the game, you have to open the wordsearch.py file. You'll be asked to open a word list file and a board file (you can create your own wordlists and boards!!).

Enter the player's name, then start looking for words!

The longer the word, the more points you'll get. 

Have fun!
